# pm-rest-sdk

Example for using the sdk is in the example folder

The sdk is built on requirejs, if you clone the repo it's all in there.

Takes three things, html file, javascript file and a json file.
Html file just is a place holder, really. The javascript file is where it all happens and json file holds the configs for connecting to the rest api
